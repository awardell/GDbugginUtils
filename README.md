# GDbugginUtils
Just a few miscellaneous scripts to help with debugging games in Godot.

enum_strings.gd contains some common, large enums from @GlobalScope in int:String form for easy printing.

print_util.gd contains a function print_properties which prints out the Array[Dictionary] retrieved from Shader.get_shader_uniform_list or from Object.get_property_list in human-readable JSON.
